# CS166 Project: Mechanic Shop Database
A datbase system that tracks information about customers, car, mechanics, car ownership, service request and billing information.

## Current Fuctions In Progress:
 + **Add Customer:** Add a new customer into the database. You should provide an interface that takes customer information (i.e. first, last name, phone, address) as input and checks if the provided information is valid based on the constraints of the database schema.
 + **Add Mechanic:** Add a new mechanic into the database. You should provide an interface that takes as input the information of a new mechanic (i.e. first, last, speciality, experience) and checks if the provided information is valid based on the constraints of the database schema.
 + **Add Car:** This function should allow a new car to be added in to the database. You should provide an interface that takes as input the information of a new car (i.e. vin, make, model, year) checking if the provided information is valid based on the constraints of the database schema.
